REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------

PageCarton requires:

- A web server with PHP support, for example:
  - Apache 2.0 (or greater) (http://httpd.apache.org/).
  - Nginx 1.1 (or greater) (http://nginx.com/).
- PHP 5.3 (or greater) (http://php.net/). For better security support it is
  recommended to update to at least 5.5.21 or 5.6.5.

For more detailed information about PageCarton requirements, including a list of
PHP extensions and configurations that are required, see "System requirements"
(http://www.PageCarton.com/) in the PageCarton.com online documentation.

For detailed information on how to configure a test server environment using a
variety of operating systems and web servers, see "Local server setup"
(http://www.PageCarton.com/download) in the PageCarton.com online documentation.

Note that all directories mentioned in this document are always relative to the
directory of your PageCarton installation, and commands are meant to be run from
this directory (except for the initial commands that create that directory).

OPTIONAL SERVER REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

- If you want to use PageCarton's "Clean URLs" feature on an Apache web server, you
  will need the mod_rewrite module and the ability to use local .htaccess
  files.

- PHP 5.5.21 provides features for improved security when used with MySQL. While
  this is not required, it is highly encouraged to use PHP 5.5.21 or 5.6.5 and
  above.
