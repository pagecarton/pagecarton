Content on this website is categorized into three different types:<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Branding Content<br>\n\t<br>\n\tThis includes logo, icons, banners, site title and descriptions.

Dynamic site content on PageCarton sites are content that are expected to change frequently. In fact, it allows one to add new dynamic content more frequently so that they could replace the old content on the website. When new dynamic content are added, they don't delete the old ones, the old ones may just be taken off the home page but they are also archived and can be accessed by search engines. This is a great way to build up site content to have a lot of information about the organization. Example dynamic contents are blog posts, event &amp; news, testimonials, products &amp; services etc. Dynamic content also have dynamic categories which can be easily updated<br>\n\t&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a class=\"pc-btn\" href=\"\/pc-admin\/Application_Article_Publisher\" target=\"_blank\">Add New Dynamic Content<\/a>&nbsp;<br>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\tClicking the link above will display an array of the kind of dynamic posts available for this website.
